['Contribute to organizations that will oppose Trump and the Republican agenda.In the wake of Trump&#8217;s victory on November 8th, a number of well-known liberal groups, such as the American Civil Liberties Union, the Anti-Defamation League, the Sierra Club, and Planned Parenthood, reported that they had seena surge in donationsandvolunteers.That was encouraging news for opponents of Trump, but it was only a start. From there, the demonstrators will march west along Independence Avenue, which is on the southern edge of the National Mall.Despite the fact that the marchers won&#8217;t be allowed near the Lincoln Memorial, which the National Park Service has cordoned off at the request of the Trump Inauguration committee, they will be clearly visible from the White House. It&#8217;s called the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, and it&#8217;s anagreement among a group of statesto award all of their votes in the Electoral College to the candidate who wins the popular vote. In this contest of words and wills, all sorts of different groups will be in need of financial support, from national organizations like the Council on American-Islamic Relations, to the political-action funds of the labor unions thatwill be targeted by Republican governors and their corporate allies, to local groups of lawyers trying to help undocumented immigrants who could be targeted for deportation.You can find lists of organizations opposed to Trumphere,here, andhere. Given his illiberal instincts, the nature of his Cabinet picks, and the scale of the Republican Party&#8217;s ambitions in rolling back the welfare and regulatory state, the battle ahead is likely to be long and bitter, waged on local, regional, and national fronts. As the Trump Administration moves forward with its reactionary agenda, it will be up to legislators in both parties not to cut dealsthat target the weak, encroach upon civil rights, or enrich the new first family.Thanks to the Internet anda growing number of apps,it is now very simple tofind your elected representativesand let them know what you think. With the winner of the popular vote having lost two of the last five Presidential elections, you might think there would be a movement to change the systemand there is. That is as it should be.The right to protest is a fundamental tenet of democracy, and Trump isn&#8217;t just another President: he&#8217;s a shameless demagogue. Contact your congressman and senator and tell them to stand up to Trump.For good or ill, the first line of defense against Trumpian erosion of democracy will be the U.S. As a daily columnist, I see my role as trying to analyze and critique the Trump program, while also trying to understand some of the phenomena that allowed him to blag his way to the verge of the White House. Get engaged on a personal level.Giving money is one thing, but making a donation to help someone else oppose Trump is no substitute for individual and collective mobilization.In any liberal democracy, the ultimate guardian of decency and civil liberties is an active civil society, which can push back against efforts to mislead the public, flout accepted norms, and centralize power. Go to change.org and join the 4.9 million people who have signeda petitioncalling on members of the Electoral College to reject Trump.Thencontact the electors for your state directlyand tell them your concerns. Most observers think that won&#8217;t happen, and, even if it did, the task of electing a President would pass to the Republican-dominated House of Representatives, which would almost certainly vote for Trump. On Thursday, the Washington, D.C., police department confirmed that it has issued a permit for the march, which will startat Independence Avenue and Third Street Southwest, right in front of the Capitol. Barney Frank, the Massachusetts Democrat who co-sponsored the legislation, told me that the only reason he and his allies managed to overcome Republican opposition, and Wall Street&#8217;s efforts to win over some Democrats, was thatthey managed to mobilize enough ordinary people to exert pressure on their elected representatives. Nine Ways to Oppose Donald Trump - The New Yorker\n\n\n \nTaking a mental-health break is only a first step toward preserving the Republic.CreditPHOTOGRAPH BY NINA BERMAN / NOOR / REDUX \n\nOver the past few weeks, a number of anguished friends and acquaintances, and even some strangers, have got in touch with me to ask what they might do to oppose Donald Trump. In still relying on the Electoral College and the rule that says each state has two seats in the U.S. Attend theWomen&#8217;s March on Washington, which will take place on Saturday, January 21st.What better way todemonstrate the scale of the opposition to Trump than to stage a huge protest on his new doorstep the very day after his Inauguration? Trump, in his speech at the Republican National Convention, has already portrayed himself as Nixon&#8217;s heir, and, should things get ugly, he would revel in presenting himself as the upholder of law and order.Genuineauthoritarians welcome disorder as an excuse to crack down on all forms of dissent. With his popular social-media feeds, and the support of an upstart right-wing press, he has found a way to go around the mainstream media and, when he deems necessary, to confront it head-on. Support local initiatives to resist the Trump and the Republican agenda.Last week, Democratic lawmakers in Sacramento, California, put forward a series of measures designed to protect undocumented immigrants in the state from deportation. &#8220;We are telling the next Administration and Congress: if you want to get to them, you have to go through us, Anthony Rendon, the speaker of the State Assembly,said. Effectively, the march is an opportunity for anybody who opposes Trump to get out there and be heard. Reacting to a suggestion from one of Trump&#8217;s advisers that he could eliminate NASA&#8216;s earth-science programs, which have done much to illuminate the advance of global warming,Brown said, &#8220;We&#8217;ve got the scientists, we&#8217;ve got the lawyers, and we&#8217;re ready to fight. That&#8217;s why, usually, one of the first thing that would-be autocrats do when they take power is attack civil society. Senate, we are beholden to the prejudices and interests of an eighteenth-century ruling class that was white, landed, and dedicated to preserving the prerogatives of their individual states. The thing to do is to pick an organization that reflects your personal interests or an issue that motivates you, get involved, and stick with it.\n******************************************\n', "Kensho's data shows materials stocks on the S&amp;P 500 have rallied 12.2% on average during the first 100 days of a presidency, while financials gain 11.1% and energy stocks rise 9.8%.

And when FDR&#8217;s daughter Anna moved into the White House in 1943, after her husband Clarence John Boettiger went into the Army, she essentially served as the First Lady during the last two years of her father&#8217;s time in office. As her father&#8217;s &#8220;expediter,&#8221; which is the unlovely word used in Washington to describe her chief function, Anna sees to it that the right papers get to the right desks at the right moment. &#8220;[People] thought they could say things to him that they couldn&rsquo;t dare say to the father.&#8221; Wead says that not only was his advice unheeded, but that the first President Bush &#8220;laid down the law&#8221; that he would not allow nepotism (though he says a more distant Bush relative did end up working there). In early 1945, shortly before Roosevelt&#8217;s death, LIFE magazine declared that &#8220;Daddy&#8217;s girl has got her work cut out for her, running Daddy,&#8221; as a photo caption explained that &#8220;Anna Roosevelt Boettiger helps handle various confidential matters for her father.&#8221; The author of that profile, John Chamberlain, detailed the intense speculation as to what exactly Anna&#8217;s function was. You won&#8217;t find her name in the State Department protocol list, which means she isn&#8217;t officially living at the White House to act as her father&#8217;s hostess during her mother&#8217;s not infrequent absences&#8230;\nShe became the organizer of her father&#8217;s time. Having the help of his children also meant that the President was not as dependent on his wife Eleanor as he otherwise would have been, which allowed her to have a public career of her own. No official description of Anna&#8217;s day has ever been offered, but Democratic politicians discovered in early 1944 that Anna was the person to call if they ever wanted to get through to the Big Boss&#8230;\nThe feature went on to show photos of her by the President&#8217;s side while meeting with foreign leaders like U.K. Now, as that business connection extends to sitting in on meetings with foreign leaders and being perceived as a valuable link to the Oval Office, they may join a select group of children and family members of presidents who &#8220;worked&#8221; for their fathers in some way during their terms. So dark, in fact, that TIME later commented that it could have been called &#8220;The Curse&#8221;: &#8220;The report detailed how Presidents&#8217; kids had a tendency to become drunks or get sick, have an accident or die young,&#8221; according to the magazine. Bush and George W. Bush and author of All the President&#8217;s Children, and even more had unofficial influence. While Chamberlain admitted that much of what was known about Anna&#8217;s role was hearsay, he noted that friends of Supreme Court Justice Bill Douglas said Anna &#8220;helped kill his chances&#8221; for the vice presidential nomination, &#8220;which may mean that Truman is partly Anna&#8217;s creation.&#8221;\nGet your history fix in one place: sign up for the weekly TIME History newsletter\nBut Anna wasn&#8217;t alone. &#8220;Most people didn&rsquo;t know he was a paraplegic, and as long as he could lean on strong arms, he could appear to be walking,&#8221; says Doris Kearns Goodwin, author of the Pulitzer Prize-winning biography No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II. Others walked away from colleges and universities, or they wrote bad papers and gave lectures about why Martin van Buren was right to oppose annexing Texas.&#8221; \nSo far, Trump&#8217;s older children appear unlikely to fall into that particular trap, as they seem loyal to him and established in their careers&mdash;though it remains to be seen what will happen after the inauguration.\n******************************************\n', 'Comeys support for the CIAs conclusion reflects the fact that the leaders of the three agencies have always been in agreement on Russian intentions, officals said, contrary to suggestions by some lawmakers that the FBI disagreed with the CIA.

As he waved his hands in the air on Wednesday and talked about how &#x201C;everybody in this room has to like me at least a little bit,&#x201D; I couldn&#x2019;t help thinking about those office signs back in the Valley and the world they have wrought. There&#x2019;s nobody like the people in this room.&#x201D;The founders and executives present may have looked on in disbelief, but they should not have been entirely surprised by the bizarre turn of events that had led them into that very room. As companies in Silicon Valley build robots that can run as fast as a cheetah, fleets of cars and trucks that can drive themselves, artificial intelligence agents that can predict weather patterns and respond to global market changes, and flocks of drones that will deliver our packages, maybe it&#x2019;s time to put more effort into thinking about how to avoid calamitous events from occurring on a larger scale. A decade later and we have a President-elect who lies, attacks people, and intentionally provokes outrage in 140-character bursts aimed directly at his 17.3 million followers.If the tech elite had no idea how their innocent products could be undermined, then now is their opportunity to pause and think about the implications of their actions on the future. Perhaps many of the people who convened at Trump Tower were so focused on those mottos that they did not realize an outcome they might create.In many ways, Silicon Valley is capable of anything. But we weren&#x2019;t the ones who created the platforms that birthed these problems; it was Silicon Valley. It read, in bold, red lettering, &#x201C;Move Fast and Break Things.&#x201D; Twitter had a similar poster that hung in its San Francisco office, noting &#x201C;Let&#x2019;s Make Better Mistakes Tomorrow.&#x201D; These mantras aren&#x2019;t an anomaly in Silicon Valley&#x2019;s playground-like campuses. And then there&#x2019;s Twitter, which has known for the better part of a decade that its platform was becoming a haven for trolls and hate speech. Perhaps growing the monthly active user base seemed more important.When I ask people who work at these companies why they can&#x2019;t fix these particular issues, they often say that &#x201C;these are hard problems to solve.&#x201D; Yes, they are, indeed. In fact, the tech industry&#x2019;s adherence to an ideology of rapid acceleration helps explain why America finds itself in its current predicament, with hackers reportedly involved in swaying our election and a growing acceptance of xenophobia spreading across the nation.

But with Donald Trump headed to the White House and Myron Ebell, CEIs director, overseeing the transition of the Environmental Protection Agency, the report, which was released last week, is a chilling preview of the attacks on environmental and health regulations that are likely to come  and a must-read for anyone trying to avert them. And, of course, huge energy and chemical companies are the ones who stand to benefit most from the assault on climate and other environmental protections suggested in the report. Rule, which limits pollution in lakes and rivers, should be overturned; the federal government should transfer ownership of land to the states or private citizens, or at the very least make it available for resource production; fuel standards for cars should be allowed to expire; and Congress shouldpush back against the Fish and Wildlife Service, which, according to CEI, is engaged in a vast new endangered species power grab.\nIf Congress follows the Freedom to Prosper blueprint, it will also roll back restrictions on toxic chemicals. As CEI sees it, efforts to address the affects of pollution from fossil fuels on our climate are really a war on affordable energy. Bizarrely, the report uses adecline in global death rates due to extreme weather since the 1920s to justify the continued burning of oil and coal and its claim that carbon-based fuels increase life expectancy. While fossil fuels have unquestionably kept many people warm over the past century, alternative energy sources can also provide plenty of heat  and have the additional appeal of reducingthe likelihood of extreme weather events. Beyond laying out specific paths to destruction, CEIs legislative roadmap helps explain the groups twisted logic for attacking environmental laws in the first place, something that may be lost on the vast majority of Americans, who want clean air and water, accept the reality ofclimate change, and are not steeped in anti-governmental legal theory. If You Want to See How Donald Trump Will Destroy the Environment, Read This Legislative Roadmap\nIf youve been wondering which environmental protections the incoming administration will target and how exactly theyll try to undo them, take a look at the Competitive Enterprise Institutes legislative agenda, Free to Prosper. Just a few months ago, this radical plan to dismantle environmental safeguards would have been dismissed as the wacky wish list of a conservative fringe group. If Congress cant dismantle the actual Clean Power Plan rule, which the report describes as an unlawful power grab that will increase consumer electricity prices, the think tank suggests a plan B, defunding the EPAs implementation of it.\n******************************************\n']
