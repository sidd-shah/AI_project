Before The Oath Of Office, An Oath By President-Elect Donald Trump To Tell The Truth : NPR\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Hotel employees watch then-Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump following a ribbon cutting ceremony at the new Trump International Hotel October 26, 2016 in Washington, D.C. But just over two weeks from now, Trump has to sit down with several lawyers and give a sworn deposition in a lawsuit involving the hotel. Trump is suing two chefs who bailed out on the hotel after his declaration of candidacy in June 2015  the speech in which he said Mexican immigrants are "bringing drugs. She responded that the restaurant lawyers were working around his schedule, that Trump\'s own statements are crucial to the case and, besides, his company Trump LLC had started the legal action. Trump has already been deposed in the Zakarian case. Clearly yes, but his lawyers didn\'t convince Judge Di Toro that it warranted postponing the deposition. Trump\'s attorneys asked that the upcoming deposition be just two hours; D.C. But whenever the video becomes public, his critics are certain to comb through it, examining both what he said and how he came across  looking for the kind of video moments that quickly flow into social media.\n Trump says they breached their contracts and is seeking $10 million from each of them. Veteran Washington lawyer William Taylor III said, "Depositions are taken by the other side for purposes of showing the person being deposed is either a liar or a crook."

A Trump spokesperson didn&rsquo;t immediately respond to a request for comment on the new call sign and whether it was selected as a nod to boxer Mike Tyson, who endorsed Trump for president.\n They have also instituted a temporary flight restriction over Trump Tower in New York City through at least Inauguration Day, as well as one over the president-elect&rsquo;s Mar-a-Lago club in Florida through the holiday season.', "China decided to return it to the US side in an appropriate manner, and China and the US have all along been in communication about it, a statement on the ministry website said. This goes to the core of how they see themselves and their reaction on this issue could end up being very significant.\nOn Thursday, Bonnie Glaser, director of the China Power Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told the Guardian the seizure of the drone looked like signalling from the Chinese in response to Trumps Taiwan call. Donald Trump accuses China of 'unpresidented' act over US navy drone | US news | The Guardian\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump has risked further inflaming US relations with China, after he used Twitter on Saturday to accuse China of an unpresidented [sic] act in its seizing of an unmanned American submarine this week. He is currently facing the belief of the White House, the CIA, the FBI and other intelligence agencies that Russia sought to influence the election in his favour  claims he has rejected and ridiculed  and questions about his business holdings and conflicts of interest that will arise when he takes office. We express regret at this.\nPentagon spokesman Peter Cook later said in a statement: Through direct engagement with Chinese authorities, we have secured an understanding that the Chinese will return the UUV [unmanned underwater vehicle] to the United States.\nOn Friday, in a press conference at the White House, Barack Obama cautioned Trump against allowing relations with China to slip into full conflict mode. On Saturday, the Chinese foreign ministry said that American hyping up was not conducive to a smooth resolution of an incident that began when a Chinese naval vessel discovered a piece of unidentified equipment and checked it to prevent any navigational safety issues, before discovering it was a US drone. A Pentagon spokesman said it was being operated by civilian contractors when it was seized on Thursday in international waters, about 57 miles north-west of Subic Bay, near the Philippines, in the South China Sea. The area in which the submarine was taken is claimed by China virtually in its entirety.", 'That is not quite taking on the establishment.\nIt is the selection of Exxons chief executive, Rex Tillerson, whom Trump described as one of the truly great business leaders of the world in an early morning tweet announcing his appointment as secretary of state, that has caused the most upset on both sides of the aisle. People will question whether the provocative actions he has taken so far are in the interests of the country or in the interests of his businesses.\nLibowitz said it could be argued that Trump is seeking to use the White House as an extension of Trump Tower. The next secretary of state must be someone who views the world with moral clarity, is free of potential conflicts of interest, has a clear sense of Americas interests, and will be a forceful advocate for Americas foreign policy goals to the president, within the administration, and on the world stage, he said. Thats why we think that the only way to remove conflict of interest is for the Trump organisations to be sold outside of the family and the proceeds moved into a blind trust.\nTrump has given no indication that he will relinquish ownership of his global real estate and licensing empire. Bernie Sanders, the Vermont senator who campaigned for the Democratic nomination and promised that, if elected, he would redistribute the vast wealth of the 1% to poorer families, has dubbed Trumps top team the cabinet of billionaires. The selection of three Goldman bankers could open Trump up to criticism as, during the campaign, the president-elect repeatedly highlighted the bank as emblematic of the corrupt global elite that had stolen the futures of hard-working Americans. He will also be forming Americas policy on the Syria crisis, the Iran nuclear deal (which Trump has described as terrible), and relations with North Korea. Businesses are driven with one guiding principle  to make the most money  and that should not be the role of the government.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  Secretary of state-designate Rex Tillerson speaks in Washington. His selection as treasury secretary should send shivers down the spine of every American who got hit hard by the financial crisis, and is the latest sign that Donald Trump has no intention of draining the swamp and every intention of running Washington to benefit himself and his rich buddies, she said. Throughout his campaign, Trump repeatedly returned to the theme of the terrible deals cut by previous administrations, from the North American Free Trade Agreement trade deal to the nuclear deal with Iran. Days before the election, Trump launched a TV advert that portrayed the Goldman chairman and chief executive Lloyd Blankfein as the personification of the global elite, which he said had robbed our working class, stripped our country of its wealth and put that money into the pockets of a handful of large corporations and political entities. Even US Senate armed services committee chairman John McCain, who has voiced support for the fighter jet in the past, has suggested the president could buy fewer of the jets in the future. Iran \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  The US deal with Iran has been heavily criticised by the president-elect. He described the Nafta with Canada and Mexico as the worst trade deal maybe ever; the Iran nuclear pact was a disaster and the worst deal ever negotiated, and would be ripped up. Trump has heavily criticised the Iran deal and, at times, threatened to dismantle it; however, his aides said that he would only seek to refine it or negotiate it. The partnership to drill for oil in the Arctic and explore in Siberia and the Black Sea was iced following the imposition of sanctions on Russia when it annexed Crimea. Trump has said he wants better relations with Russia and has complimented Vladimir Putin, including his leadership after the Russian president was accused of killing journalists. The question is not whether he is seeking to run the White House like a business, but more whether he will be running it as his business. Jordan Libowitz, of the DC watchdog Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, said Trumps cabinet had the potential for the most conflicts of interest ever. This would be extremely difficult and the president-elect has not been clear on what he would replace it with. The likelihood of tearing up the Iran deal is slim, as many of the deals original critics oppose completely dismantling it, including Trumps nominee for secretary of defence, James Mattis. Trump went on to pledge: Billions of dollars can and will be saved on military (and other) purchases after 20 January.\nHow likely is he to get his way? As well as a phalanx of Democrats, leading Republican senators Marco Rubio and Lindsey Graham, and John McCain, the chairman of the Senate armed services committee, have raised concerns about Tillersons close relationship with Vladimir Putin and conflicts of interest arising from Exxons interests in Russia. But Taiwan is non-negotiable for China and any such move is likely to meet with retaliation that will hurt the US economy and potentially lead to a global trade war  or worse. Trump said Cohn, who has worked at Goldman for 26 years and amassed some $200m of the banks stock, would put his talents as a highly successful businessman to work for the American people. His team  if all are confirmed by the Senate  will be worth 50 times the $250m combined wealth of George W Bushs first cabinet, which the media at the time dubbed the team of millionaires. Responding to liberal consternation at the sheer wealth of the prospective appointees, Trump told his audience: A newspaper [the New York Times] criticised me and said: Why cant they have people of modest means? Because I want people that made a fortune. As president-elect, Trump has so far nominated a number of billionaires, three Goldman Sachs bankers and the chief executive of the worlds largest oil firm to senior positions. But beyond the accusations of brazen hypocrisy, it is the enmeshing of business interests with affairs of state which is causing the deepest concern. He nominated former Exxon chair Rex Tillerson, who has with close ties to Russia, as secretary of state, and has rejected the CIAelection claims. Meanwhile, as Trump is exempt from many of the laws that apply to his appointments, he is taking full advantage. There have been business leaders, and very rich ones, in the cabinet in the past but never of this depth and scale. And deal-making is what the next White House will be all about. Many in the US agree the programme is out of control. The F-35 programme and cost is out of control, Trump said on Twitter, a pronouncement that knocked Lockheeds share price  and those of other defence contractors involved in the project, including Britains BAE. He will help craft economic policies that will grow wages for our workers, stop the exodus of jobs overseas and create many great new opportunities for Americans who have been struggling.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  Goldman Sachs president and chief Gary Cohn has been named as Trumps top economic advisor.', "Mr Trump has promised to divorce himself &quot;in total&quot; from his business, but postponed the announcement of how he plans to do this until January. He has so far insisted instead that his children will run the company and that he will have &quot;nothing to do&quot; with the management. The revelations came amid concerns that Mr Trump's refusal to divest himself from his businesses - a standard practice for past presidents - will lead to conflicts of interest during his presidency.", 'Navy drone on Friday an "unpresidented [sic] act" before deleting the typo and replacing it with a correctly spelled statement.Yet the intervening hour and a half in which the mistake sat unfixed gave the Twitter-sphere plenty of time to get in a few jokes at the expense of Trump\'s spelling skills.The hashtag "#unpresidented" quickly climbed to the top spot on the list of trending Twitter topics in the United States Saturday morning.

When the housing market tanked and the Great Recession of 2007-2009 began, the federal government took over Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, both deeply underwater, sending their stock prices plummeting. During this time speculators like Paulson bought up stock at bargain basement prices and began lobbying the government to end federal control and oversight of the lenders and then recapitalize them and release them back to the private market. Earlier this year, Mulvaney introduced legislation blocking payments by the housing lenders Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to funds that support low income housing unless both Fannie and Freddie are recapitalized and released. He then led Trump&rsquo;s economic advisers for the remainder of the campaign and now sits on the transition team advising him on economic policy. The stock prices for both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have increased by over 100 percent since before the Nov. Such a policy would, undoubtedly, send the stock price soaring and those who had tens of millions worth of penny-stock would see billions in profit  including Paulson.&nbsp;Trump had invested between $3 million and $15 million into Paulson&rsquo;s funds, according to the president-elect&rsquo;s&nbsp;most recent disclosure report filed in May.&nbsp;\nSo far, Trump&rsquo;s picks for his economic team are all supporters of recapitalization and release.', 'advocacy organization aimed at combating homophobia in team sports.&nbsp;\nWhile LGBTQ rights face an uncertain future under a Trump presidency, the Warwick Rowers are calling on the president-elect and other world leaders to acknowledge equal rights for everyone whether they like it or not.&nbsp;\n&ldquo;As straight allies, we believe that everyone should have the same human rights, regardless of gender or sexuality,&rdquo; the guys say in the above video. &ldquo;And as athletes, we believe sport can play a vital role in promoting a happy, healthy and inclusive world for everyone.&rdquo;&nbsp;\nIn spite of the buzz their steamy photos generate, the guys say the calendar has a more significant aim, namely as a &ldquo;reminder that we&rsquo;re all equals in this challenging journey called life.&rdquo; Hence, they&rsquo;ve sent copies to Trump, Vice President-elect Mike Pence and other leaders in an effort to secure their &ldquo;commitment to equality, inclusion and human rights.&rdquo;\nAs we continue to grapple with the challenges that a Trump presidency will bring, we&rsquo;re prouder than ever to have these rowers in the trenches for a cause!
