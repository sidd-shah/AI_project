Yet Another Donald Trump Pick Has A Habit Of Spreading Dangerous Conspiracy Theories | The Huffington Post\nPresident-elect Donald Trump announced Thursday that he&rsquo;s chosen Fox News contributor Monica Crowley as the National Security Council&rsquo;s senior director of strategic communications.', 'His rhetoric is famously scalding; after Israeli Defense Forces commandos killed nine Turks on a relief boat headed to the Gaza Strip, Danon wrote to Turkey&#8217;s prime minister saying &#8220;We are sorry that due to the IDF&#8217;s over-cautious behavior, only nine terrorists were killed&#8230;&#8221; Danon&#8217;s appointment to Israel&#8217;s premiere diplomatic post&mdash; like Dayan&#8217;s as envoy to the largest concentration of American Jews&mdash;was as far as you can get from business as usual in Israeli diplomacy. It&#8217;s like this: For the last three years Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the man who leads Israel, has sent signal after signal that he&#8217;s done with peace talks, or ever pulling Israeli troops out of the West Bank. &#8220;There has never been a two-state solution,&#8221; Friedman wrote in August, &#8220;only a two-state narrative.&#8221; And if it was that was a narrative in which moderate Palestinians invested pretty much everything, a story in which almost the entire world continues to believe, the crystalline signal from both Trump Tower and Jerusalem is that it&#8217;s all over now. What Donald Trump&#039;s Pick for Ambassador to Israel David Friedman Means\n\n\n\nDon&#8217;t even try thinking of Donald Trump&#8217;s choice for ambassador to Israel as a diplomat. Danon was Netanyahu&#8217;s remarkable choice for the international body where the topic of Israel&#8217;s 50-year occupation of Palestinian territory is a chronic one. Earlier in the year, Brazil rejected his appointment as Israel&#8217;s ambassador to Brasilia, citing his settler background. More recently the signals arrived in the form of diplomats&mdash;men who, like Friedman, had no prior experience in the subtle arts of statecraft, but whose biographies and attitudes said a great deal. He is a settler, a Jewish Israeli who moved to the West Bank in order to stake a claim to rocky hills that are also home to some two million Palestinians. Gone is the talk of brokering peace in the biggest deal ever, proving his bona fides as a dealmaker by being &#8220;sort of a neutral guy&#8221; or &#8220;honest broker,&#8221; as Trump himself put it in the campaign.', '&#8220;Roosevelt loved to gossip, and Anna was exactly the person to do that with,&#8221; says Goodwin, &#8220;which gave Eleanor the freedom to go away without feeling guilty.&#8221; That freedom allowed Eleanor to become &#8220;the most important First Lady probably in the history of the country&#8221; and transform the mostly ceremonial role into an activist one. And when FDR&#8217;s daughter Anna moved into the White House in 1943, after her husband Clarence John Boettiger went into the Army, she essentially served as the First Lady during the last two years of her father&#8217;s time in office. As her father&#8217;s &#8220;expediter,&#8221; which is the unlovely word used in Washington to describe her chief function, Anna sees to it that the right papers get to the right desks at the right moment. &#8220;[People] thought they could say things to him that they couldn&rsquo;t dare say to the father.&#8221; Wead says that not only was his advice unheeded, but that the first President Bush &#8220;laid down the law&#8221; that he would not allow nepotism (though he says a more distant Bush relative did end up working there). In early 1945, shortly before Roosevelt&#8217;s death, LIFE magazine declared that &#8220;Daddy&#8217;s girl has got her work cut out for her, running Daddy,&#8221; as a photo caption explained that &#8220;Anna Roosevelt Boettiger helps handle various confidential matters for her father.&#8221; The author of that profile, John Chamberlain, detailed the intense speculation as to what exactly Anna&#8217;s function was. You won&#8217;t find her name in the State Department protocol list, which means she isn&#8217;t officially living at the White House to act as her father&#8217;s hostess during her mother&#8217;s not infrequent absences&#8230;\nShe became the organizer of her father&#8217;s time. Having the help of his children also meant that the President was not as dependent on his wife Eleanor as he otherwise would have been, which allowed her to have a public career of her own. No official description of Anna&#8217;s day has ever been offered, but Democratic politicians discovered in early 1944 that Anna was the person to call if they ever wanted to get through to the Big Boss&#8230;\nThe feature went on to show photos of her by the President&#8217;s side while meeting with foreign leaders like U.K. Now, as that business connection extends to sitting in on meetings with foreign leaders and being perceived as a valuable link to the Oval Office, they may join a select group of children and family members of presidents who &#8220;worked&#8221; for their fathers in some way during their terms. So dark, in fact, that TIME later commented that it could have been called &#8220;The Curse&#8221;: &#8220;The report detailed how Presidents&#8217; kids had a tendency to become drunks or get sick, have an accident or die young,&#8221; according to the magazine. Bush and George W. Bush and author of All the President&#8217;s Children, and even more had unofficial influence. While Chamberlain admitted that much of what was known about Anna&#8217;s role was hearsay, he noted that friends of Supreme Court Justice Bill Douglas said Anna &#8220;helped kill his chances&#8221; for the vice presidential nomination, &#8220;which may mean that Truman is partly Anna&#8217;s creation.&#8221;\nGet your history fix in one place: sign up for the weekly TIME History newsletter\nBut Anna wasn&#8217;t alone. &#8220;Most people didn&rsquo;t know he was a paraplegic, and as long as he could lean on strong arms, he could appear to be walking,&#8221; says Doris Kearns Goodwin, author of the Pulitzer Prize-winning biography No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II. Others walked away from colleges and universities, or they wrote bad papers and gave lectures about why Martin van Buren was right to oppose annexing Texas.&#8221; \nSo far, Trump&#8217;s older children appear unlikely to fall into that particular trap, as they seem loyal to him and established in their careers&mdash;though it remains to be seen what will happen after the inauguration.', 'The Reverend Doctor William Barber II, president of both the North Carolina NAACP and the Repairers of the Breach, said to me in a text, &ldquo;For Speaker [Tim] Moore and Senate Pro Temp [Phil] Berger to do this under the cover of having sessions supposedly called to help flood and wildfire victims is one of the worst forms of hypocrisy we have seen in this state since the days of Jim Crow, when politicians passed racist legislation while claiming to be upholding the American way.&rdquo;\nIn effect, the Republican leadership aimed to secure unprecedented unilateral control over the state of North Carolina. Barber, was successful in helping to defeat Governor McCrory and, in some ways, to shift the center of moral gravity in the state&mdash;only to confront a special session of extremists who could give less than a damn about their efforts or the results of the state election. He said, &ldquo;After fighting the election results for a month, the North Carolina GOP has called a special session of the Legislature to subvert the Governor-elect&rsquo;s powers just before Christmas&#8230; This group of grand extremists are trying to change the makeup of boards of election, make partisan the states courts and deny access to the Supreme Court of North Carolina by changing appellate procedures. But the good folks in North Carolina&mdash;as they have battled in the streets, at the ballot box and in the courtroom&mdash;exposed the extremists for who and what they are. Barber and a marvelous coalition of forces across the state have organized to resist what they rightly describe as the extremism of the state&rsquo;s Republican Party. With Governor Pat McCrory&rsquo;s signature, the governor-elect will lose his ability to control the state&rsquo;s election boards and to appoint trustees of the University of North Carolina. Barber described the legislative session as &ldquo;The Herod Special Session in North Carolina,&rdquo; a Biblical reference to the Roman client king of Judea who desperately wanted to hold on to power at the time of the birth of Jesus. From the Justice Department to the Departments of Education, the Interior and Health and Human Services as well as the EPA, we have to brace ourselves for four years of extremism. And I suspect that if Trump doesn&rsquo;t get his way, he will try, as the Republicans in North Carolina are doing, to flout democratic norms&mdash;to throw democracy into the trash bin. &ldquo;This is what Herods do when their power is threatened by love and justice,&rdquo; the Rev.', 'But there is no law governing what a party official can do with questions if they receive them ahead of a primary debate.&nbsp;\nThe bigger problem with Trump&rsquo;s tweet, however, is that he&rsquo;s asking Americans to view this massive cyber-espionage campaign  in which Russian hackers also&nbsp;targeted Republican&nbsp;political committees, candidates and campaign staff  as some kind of public service to America,&nbsp;because it &ldquo;revealed&rdquo; that Brazile had shared a debate question.&nbsp;\nAt the same time, Trump appeared to be oblivious to the fact that the Russian cyberattack was just that, an attack by a foreign power. They showed that Donna Brazile,&nbsp;who was interim chair of the DNC at the time of the leak,&nbsp;had shared a primary debate question with&nbsp;Hillary Clinton&rsquo;s&nbsp;campaign, ahead of a March debate between the Democratic presidential candidate and her rival Sen. What is clear is that the hacking to which Trump was referring was the same Russian state-sponsored attack that he&rsquo;s repeatedly downplayed and dismissed.', 'Contribute to organizations that will oppose Trump and the Republican agenda.In the wake of Trump&#8217;s victory on November 8th, a number of well-known liberal groups, such as the American Civil Liberties Union, the Anti-Defamation League, the Sierra Club, and Planned Parenthood, reported that they had seena surge in donationsandvolunteers.That was encouraging news for opponents of Trump, but it was only a start. From there, the demonstrators will march west along Independence Avenue, which is on the southern edge of the National Mall.Despite the fact that the marchers won&#8217;t be allowed near the Lincoln Memorial, which the National Park Service has cordoned off at the request of the Trump Inauguration committee, they will be clearly visible from the White House. In this contest of words and wills, all sorts of different groups will be in need of financial support, from national organizations such as the Council on American-Islamic Relations to the political-action funds of the labor unions thatwill be targeted by Republican governors and their corporate allies to local groups of lawyers trying to help undocumented immigrants who could be targeted for deportation.You can find lists of organizations opposed to Trumphere,here, andhere.

Given his illiberal instincts, the nature of his Cabinet picks, and the scale of the Republican Party&#8217;s ambitions in rolling back the welfare and regulatory state, the battle ahead is likely to be long and bitter, waged on local, regional, and national fronts. As the Trump Administration moves forward with its reactionary agenda, it will be up to legislators in both parties not to cut dealsthat target the weak, encroach upon civil rights, or enrich the new first family.Thanks to the Internet anda growing number of apps,it is now very simple tofind your elected representativesand let them know what you think. That is as it should be.The right to protest is a fundamental tenet of democracy, and Trump isn&#8217;t just another President: he&#8217;s a shameless demagogue. With the winner of the popular vote having lost two of the past five Presidential elections, you might think there would be a movement to change the systemand there is. Contact your congressman and senator and tell them to stand up to Trump.For good or ill, the first line of defense against a Trumpian erosion of democracy will be the U.S. As a daily columnist, I see my role as trying to analyze and critique the Trump program, while also trying to understand some of the phenomena that allowed him to blag his way to the verge of the White House. Get engaged on a personal level.Giving money is one thing, but making a donation to help someone else oppose Trump is no substitute for individual and collective mobilization.In any liberal democracy, the ultimate guardian of decency and civil liberties is an active civil society, which can push back against efforts to mislead the public, flout accepted norms, and centralize power. Go to change.org and join the 4.9 million people who have signeda petitioncalling on members of the Electoral College to reject Trump.Thencontact the electors for your state directlyand tell them your concerns. Most observers think that won&#8217;t happen, and, even if it did, the task of electing a President would pass to the Republican-dominated House of Representatives, which would almost certainly vote for Trump. Nine Ways to Oppose Donald Trump - The New Yorker\n\n\n \nTaking a mental-health break is only a first step toward preserving the Republic.CreditPHOTOGRAPH BY NINA BERMAN / NOOR / REDUX \n\nOver the past few weeks, a number of anguished friends and acquaintances, and even some strangers, have got in touch with me to ask what they might do to oppose Donald Trump. On Thursday, the Washington, D.C., police department confirmed that it has issued a permit for the march, which will startat Independence Avenue and Third Street Southwest, right in front of the Capitol. Barney Frank, the Massachusetts Democrat who co-sponsored the legislation, told me that the only reason he and his allies managed to overcome Republican opposition, and Wall Street&#8217;s efforts to win over some Democrats, was thatthey managed to mobilize enough ordinary people to exert pressure on their elected representatives. In still relying on the Electoral College and the rule that says each state has two seats in the U.S. Attend theWomen&#8217;s March on Washington, which will take place on Saturday, January 21st.What better way todemonstrate the scale of the opposition to Trump than to stage a huge protest on his new doorstep the very day after his Inauguration? Trump, in his speech at the Republican National Convention, has already portrayed himself as Nixon&#8217;s heir, and, should things get ugly, he would revel in presenting himself as the upholder of law and order.Genuineauthoritarians welcome disorder as an excuse to crack down on all forms of dissent. With his popular social-media feeds, and the support of an upstart right-wing press, he has found a way to go around the mainstream media and, when he deems necessary, to confront it head on. &#8220;We are telling the next Administration and Congress: if you want to get to them, you have to go through us, Anthony Rendon, the speaker of the State Assembly,said. Effectively, the march is an opportunity for anybody who opposes Trump to get out there and be heard. Reacting to a suggestion from one of Trump&#8217;s advisers that he could eliminate NASA&#8216;s earth-science programs, which have done much to illuminate the advance of global warming,Brown said, &#8220;We&#8217;ve got the scientists, we&#8217;ve got the lawyers, and we&#8217;re ready to fight. That&#8217;s why, usually, one of the first thing that would-be autocrats do when they take power is attack civil society. The thing to do is to pick an organization that reflects your personal interests or an issue that motivates you, get involved, and stick with it. Senate, we are beholden to the prejudices and interests of an eighteenth-century ruling class that was white, landed, and dedicated to preserving the prerogatives of individual states. assessment that Moscow had tried to help him win the election &#8220;ridiculous.&#8221; Butthis week Trump was powerless to prevent leading Republicans, including John McCain and Mitch McConnell, from calling for congressional hearings on the extent and origins of the Russian cyberattacks.', "Donald Trump says his supporters were 'violent' - CNNPolitics.com\nBy Jeremy Diamond, CNNUpdated 9:52 PM ET, Fri December 16, 2016 "]
