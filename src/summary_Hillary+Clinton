She needed more notecards than Mark, though, to point out all of the ways Trump could fuck over the world.. And yes, HRC is trying to win a heart: the heart of an elector.Clinton, played by McKinnon on SNL, decides to take matters into her own hands and shows up at an electors door with an armful of poster boards because its Christmas, mocking the classic Love Actually scene where Mark (played by Andrew Lincoln) confesses his love to Juliet (played by Keira Knightley), who is married to his best friend.. If Donald Trump becomes president he will kill us all, the last two posters read.

.. .. .. He pointed out that Clintons first campaign rally last year was held at New Yorks Four Freedoms Park, named for President Franklin Roosevelts Four Freedoms, but she managed only to mention three freedoms thereignoring freedom of worship.. She also made several appearances at black churches, a reliable source of Democratic votes.But she spent little time talking about her own faith on the campaign trail, and even less time speaking explicitly to believers about theirsthe kind of uncomfortable reach that might have peeled away religious voters looking for a reason not to vote for Trump.. It was decidedly different than past campaigns, said Ed Stetzer, executive director of the Billy Graham Center for Evangelism at Wheaton College in Illinoisand a prominent observer of evangelical culture.. Why Hillary Clinton bombed with white evangelical voters... .. .. 2.. So he praised the material he did not see.. Turn that bus around, the Clinton team ordered SEIU.. He declared he was delighted with the beautiful colors and the exquisite pattern.. Dovere's article is a fascinating autopsy of how an organization's leadership team utterly failed, and a blueprint for leaders in any type of organization to avoid the same, predictable fate.. If you are an organizational leader,  here are four lessons from Team Clinton's lossthat you should think long and hard about as it relates to how you lead :1.. Those volunteers needed to stay in Iowa to fool Donald Trump into competing there, not drive to Michigan, where the Democrats models projected a 5-point win through the morning of Election Day.. Yet, amidst the story of these arguments was this single line that was both astonishing and yet predictable:Politico spoke to a dozen officials working on or with Clintons Michigan campaign, and more than a dozen scattered among other battleground states, her Brooklyn headquarters and in Washington who describe an ongoing fight about campaign tactics, an inability to get top leadership to change course.. Clinton conceded the presidency to Donald Trump in a phone call early Wednesday morning, a stunning end to a campaign that appeared poised right up until election day to make her the first woman elected U.S. president.. They believed they were more experienced, which they were.. But, for leaders interested in things other than politics, Edward-Isaac Dovere'spiece for Politico --"How ClintonLost Michigan--and Blew the Election"-- is the most interesting and insightful piece of journalism to come out of this post-election period.. So when, a week-and-a-half out, the Service Employees International Union started hearing anxiety out of Michigan, union officials decided to reroute their volunteers, giving a desperate team on the ground around Detroit some hope..

Who had an incentive to defeat Mrs. Clinton?. Whos right?Here is the back story.The American intelligence community rarely speaks with one voice.. Though the truthful revelation of private facts may have altered some voters attitudes, there is no evidence that it altered ballot totals.. We know that from the Edward Snowden revelations.. We also know from Mr. Snowden that the NSA can monitor and identify all digital communications within the United States, coming into the United States and leaving the United States... .. .. 2.. The Russian-state sponsored hacks that released damaging information through Wikileaks likely depressed the millennial and progressive voter turnout in the general election.Also, the litany of nonsensical Benghazi hearings purposely took a toll on Mrs. Clintons reputiation.. Clinton gracefully faced an 11-hour interrogation by the House Select Committee on Benghazi and still the GOP led investigation found only she used a private server.Nonetheless, even FBI director James Comey agreed while Clinton was careless, she never intentionally violated any laws when she used the aforementioned server..

My best estimate was the algorithm wasnt completely at fault, but was so dependent on erroneous information, we couldnt capitalize on our expansive ground game.. This complex, omnipotent algorithm was supposed to be Clintons saving grace.. Our ground game was simple enough: the voting database would spit out names of potential voters, and we would simply canvass the area reminding them to vote or support Clinton.Regrettably, the voter database was excruciatingly erroneous; a striking majority of households were either no longer residents, not voters, or Republicans.. This massive amount of money should have given Clinton a substantial advantage.In politics, money raised is important, but how money spent is even more important..

'There are now reports that Vladimir Putin personally directed the covert campaign to elect Trump,' Podesta wrote.. 'The public deserves to know exactly what happened, why and what can be done to prevent future attacks,' he said..

Hillary, meanwhile, is smiling to the camera  wearing a black and white tweed jacket over a fuchsia top.Wait.. She asked my dogs name. A couple weeks later, Ellen, who calls herself the Sacagawea of the Arboretum, let Phoebe off her leash.. You could hear a bird or two.. For all they knew, they might see a coyote or some rare mushrooms or Hillary Clinton.. It was like Al Gore growing a beard after his 2000 election loss.. She and her husband were Chappaqua neighbors who enjoyed an invigorating, mind-clearing tromp in the local nature preserve as much as anyone else.. They were holding hands. Ellen remembered Bill talking during his convention speech this summer about how he and Hillary had taken a walk on their first date and had been walking and talking ever since.. Once, a Chappaquaian named Judy Fuhrer was driving along the road by the preserve, listening to an audio recording of Bill Clintons 1,008-page memoir.. Bill was in front, Ellen said.. I have no idea.

Sometimes she was here on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon, in casual clothes, just like the rest of us, said Carol, stepping over some rocks.. You think so? said Carol, adjusting her scarf.. Youre wonderful. I stood there with my arms wide open and Im not even a hugger and I gave her this big hug.. He had just missed her.. Thats who lost, Carol said, and soon, they reached the last part of their hike, a path winding through a marshy area of low shrubs with long yellowy leaves.. They stopped and looked around.. They tried to imagine what Hillary would be doing next.. He said, Whats it like in there today? Lew recalled.. She had on a beautiful sweater.. The Clintons were well shod.. The dog was bounding ahead full speed when she started barking, and then Hillary and Bill Clinton appeared again, this time with their daughter, Chelsea, Chelseas husband and their children.

ABEDIN CLAIMS SHE NEVER RECEIVED FBI WARRANTClinton was known to keep an extremely small and tight-knit group around her, and, indeed, during the 2016 primary and presidential campaign, the core group  including Campaign Manager Robbie Mook, Communications Director Jennifer Palmieri, adviser Cheryl Mills, Podesta and Abedin  never changed.. Where in most presidential campaigns the circle grows broader and broader, hers grew smaller and smaller, a source told Vanity Fair.. They reinforced all the bad habits.One of the most important people in that inner circle was Abedin, 40, whohas been by Clintons side since she was a White House intern during President Bill Clintons tenure.. Clinton advisers point fingers at Huma Abedin, inner circle for loss  Fox NewsWhile many of Hillary Clintons top advisers have focused their post-presidential election fury on blaming alleged Russian interference and FBI Director James Comey for Clintons loss, some in the so-called Hillaryland orbit are looking inward, including pointing fingers at Clintons most-trusted aide: Huma Abedin.Also there were Bill and Chelsea Clinton and Chelseas husband, Marc Mezvinsky..
